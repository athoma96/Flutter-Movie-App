# Flutter-Movie-App

Designed a multi-orientation movie information flutter app that implements sliver widgets along with url launcher package.
Used different Sliver widgets to provide different movie genres along with a custom scroll view of clickable tiles that would display an image of a movie, its title, director and release year.
A short press on the tile will direct to selected movie’s poster, then another short press on poster will transition the user to the movies IMDB webpage. A long press on the movie option will bring a pop-up menu which will display 3 options to the user to choose from: 1. Option to see Movie’s info. 2. Option to go to movie’s IMDB page; 3. Option to go to movie’s Wikipedia page.
